###Insight Data Engineering - Coding Challenge

March 21, 2015

###General information about my code
1 My program starts by using path of the current directory of the machine running the program (using os package)
2 I used os package and numpy, but I only load numpy as dependency expecting os is included by default with python
3 I included both problems in the same program, as the logic coincides and thus making it less computationally expensive
4 When I print the word count format I chose to use a format that aligns and puts space (for alignment for longer words)

* Finally, I like the FAQ provided to answer my "what if " questions. THANK YOU!
